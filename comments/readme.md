# Comments widget

A Facebook style comments widget. It doesn't really do anything yet, but there's a skeleton in place and a bunch of tests you need to make pass.

## Building it

To compile the JSX files you'll need to install react-tools with npm,
the node.js package manager.

`npm install -g react-tools`

To continually compile when the files change run the following
command.

`jsx --watch -x jsx . build`

## Running it

There's no server or persisting going on here, just UI. Just open the
[HTML file](comments.html).

## The TODO list

There are only tests! Open the [Test HTML file](tests.html) to run them, your job is to make them pass.
